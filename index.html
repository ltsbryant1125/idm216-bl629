                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>This project was a redesign of the Happy Sunshine food truck app. The goal was to improve the overall user experience of the ordering process and make a fully functioning application from the designs done in a previous class. We drew inspiration from the food truck's color scheme and went through a full 10-week production pipeline in a team of 5. Each team member had a specialized role, being responsible for one specific aspect of the project.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>For this project, I was put into a team of 5 in order to create a functioning version of an app wireframe from the preceding class. Over the course of 10 weeks, our team created an interface that would function on mobile, tablet, and desktop. This project was created as a hypothetical app for the Happy Sunshine foo truck that is located on Drexel University’s campus. It was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP/mySQL. The stylings of the app were already created through the course that preceded this one, so most of the work was done in making those designs functional. We took this project through a full production-style project pipeline, with each individual having a specified role and responsibilities to tend to over the course of this project. My role in this team was the data architect. I was responsible with managing all media produced and used by our team. This includes video recordings of user testing, images used in the project, and user surveys.</p>

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge that the team faced was the implementation of multiple database tables in order to give the impression of a fully functioning app. This includes being able to update prices from the admin’s side, updating prices in the cart when a user adds or removes items, and keeping track of user-favorited items. Another challenge that the team faced was the number of menu items and combinations of different toppings that can be created by the user.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create an optimized workflow for the user</li>
                    <li>Fully code a dynamic web application</li>
                    <li>Improve overall user experience of the app</li>
                </ol>

            <p>The designs and overall aesthetic of the app were completed in the previous UX class. From these wireframes, we created a style guide with the colors and fonts that we would use in the final design.</p>
            <img class="display" src="images/styleTile.png" alt="Style Guide">
            <p>We started by building an alpha version of our site and conducting user testing with it. The UX designers and I conducted user-testing through Zoom with 8 users. We recorded their responses through a Google Form that the designers would fill out as we conducted the testing. From there, we took the feedback we received and implemented it for our beta. We conducted testing again and the feedback we received would be used for the final step of the project.</p>

            <p>As the data architect of the team, my primary responsibilities were to manage all media utilized by the team. This includes images from the style guide, video recordings of user testing, and creation of the Google Form surveys.</p>

                <p>The final build of our web application is a functional, dynamic recreation of the Happy Sunshine wireframes that we received. Each page is responsive and uses the truck's color scheme in order to preserve its identity. I was able to manage our files and videos well, and keep everyone organized.</p>

                <p>Overall, I am happy with what we achieved as a team. I think that we were able to take the wireframes that we had and fleshed them out to the best of our ability. As the data architect, I was able to manage the files that the team utilized well and kept them organized in our Microsoft Teams. The final results function well and preserve the identity of the truck well.</p>
